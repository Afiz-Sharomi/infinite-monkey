> "_The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare."_

This theorem can be simulated with computers and through genetic algorithms a final state can be realised with much greater speed.

**Progress**
Currently the program is able to:
- [x] Allow user to input a string.
- [x] Read text from file.
- [x] Print generations of strings and fitness to the console.
- [x] Generate desired text via crossover and mutation.
- [x] Halt once the desired text has been created.
- [ ] Provide a GUI interface.
